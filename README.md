# WeatherBot
A discord bot that tells you the weather in swedish cities. 
It uses the open API from SMHI to get the weather, and the coordinates of various swedish cities to know where to check. It is also able to do a few other
tricks such as googling. 

If you want to use it in your channel just create a new token in Main.
